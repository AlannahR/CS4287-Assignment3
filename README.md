# CS4287-Assignment3
DQN


1. Objectives
To implement a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent using a Deep Q Network (DQN) applied to the
game of Atari in the OpenAI Gym environment.

Please email the lecturer with a request for permission to use an alternative to Atari if committed to a
different simulator and/or environment. Provide a link to the alternative and a paragraph stating the
rationale. The subject must be “CS4287: ALTERNATIVE”


2. Submission
Submit a pdf describing
1. Why Reinforcement Learning is the machine learning paradigm of choice for this task (2 marks,
0.5 pages)

2. The Environment (3 marks, 1 page):
a. the Atari game selected,
b. the inputs received from the OpenAI Gym environment, and
c. the control settings for the joystick.
3. Implementation (8 marks, approximately 4-6 pages approximately):
a. Capture and pre-processing of the data (2 marks),
b. The network structure (2 marks),
c. The Q learning update applied to the weights (2 marks),
d. Other concepts that you deem to be of significance, particularly independently
researched techniques to speed up learning should you happen to use any (2 marks).



Coding fragments and/or diagrams should be included to illustrate the concepts under
discussion.


4. Results – plots with short accompanying explanations of the information conveyed (2 marks).


5. Evaluation of the results (3 marks):
a. How does one evaluate the performance of the RL agent?
b. Is the agent learning?
6. References (2 marks)
The suggested page count for sections 1-3 of the report are for guidance only and are not mandatory.

Submit a Jupyter notebook with the code where:

 The book is named CS4287-Prj3-ID1-ID2

o Where ID1 and ID2 are the student id numbers of the team members

 The first line in the book is a comment with names and ID numbers of the team members
 The second line in the book should be a comment stating if the code executes to the end without
an error.
 The third line in the book should be a comment with a link to the original source where you
opted to reuse an existing implementation.
